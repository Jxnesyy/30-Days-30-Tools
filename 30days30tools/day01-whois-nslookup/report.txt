I performed a basic reconnaissance of the domain [test.com] using WHOIS and NSLOOKUP. The WHOIS data revealed that the domain is registered with [Registrar Name] and has its registration privacy [enabled/disabled]. The NSLOOKUP queries showed that the domain resolves to IP address [127.0.0.255], uses [Nameservers], and is hosted by [Hosting Provider if known]. No unusual or suspicious DNS records were identified. This gives a basic understanding of the domainâ€™s ownership, DNS setup, and potential infrastructure exposure.
